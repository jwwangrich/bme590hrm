# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.
*       @mlp6 @microelastic @ad12 @davidbradway 

# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# So if a pull request only touches javascript files, only these owners
# will be requested to review.

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in an apps directory
# anywhere in your repository.
